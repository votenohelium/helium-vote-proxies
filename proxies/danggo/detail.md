## Experience

In Helium since 2020 with a comprehensive understanding of the project and its tokenomics. Gave up the mentor-role in 2023 and reduced active engagement in Discord due to time constraints - but have continued to passively keep close tabs on developments.

## Voting Philosophy

HRPs bundle several items and are put to vote as a package. I intend to weigh each item w/o losing sight of the package to determine which vote decision will better serve the Helium Network.

Helium Network = IOT + MOBILE -> both compete for the HNT cake. The goal is balancing the reasonable interests of both subnetworks in pursuit of determining what will serve the network as a whole.
