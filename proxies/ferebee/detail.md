## Experience

Helium maximalist since 2020, with IOT deployments in Europe since 2021. HIP believer and principal author of HIP-138, Return to HNT, which takes Helium back to HNT as the single token of the ecosystem. Contributing author on HIP-141, Single-Token Governance and Helium Release Proposals. Author on other HIPs, with a focus on making Helium tokenomics and governance simple and well-defined.

When I’m not working at my day job, selling and supporting Apple computers since 1992, I spend too much time on Discord and Twitter, bullposting Helium.

## Voting Philosophy

With skin in the game, I’m focused on the long-term success of Helium as a whole. 

The Nova team moves fast. Under the new HRP governance, I intend to track the HRPs as they evolve, and engage with the team if I believe that line items require clarification, or should be broken out as HIPs to build community consensus.

I follow HIPs and participate in their discussions, so I can vote with confidence for the best outcome.

DePIN will rule the world, and Helium is DePIN.
