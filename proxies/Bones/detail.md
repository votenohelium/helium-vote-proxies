## Experience

Author HIP-116 (Passed)
Involved with iot and lorawan since 2018 and Helium since 2021.

## Voting Philosophy

As a user, deployer and operator who also runs a Helium OpenLNS. Any positive changes to increase
network use are important to me as long as the ideas hold water. Not affraid to ask questions and
admit when I'm wrong.
